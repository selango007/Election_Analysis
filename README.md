# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is to analyze the recently concluded election and provide the below results.

1. Calculate total votes cast.
2. Get the list of candidates who got votes.
3. Calculate total votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received.
5. Determine the winning candidate based on popular votes.

## Resources
The below 2 resources were used.

1. election_results.csv file whihc is the data source.
2. Python3 software code snd VS Code to determne read and process the file, then provide the results.

## Summary
When we run the Python file , we following steps are executed.

1. Open the election_results.csv file
2. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
3. Display the list of candidates received the votes.
4. The results are in the below format:
    Candidate 1 received "x%" of votes. Received "y" votes.

    The winner was "Candidate (1,2 or 3) who received "x%" of votes and received "y" votes."
    
# Challenge Overview.
The Pythin code still assumes clean data source. Though Python is a powerful software to analyze the data ad provide the results in desired format, the data should be cleaned before even we do the analysis using Python.

# Challenge Summary:
Python does not support Data Cleaning, probably that step can be done using SQL or ETL
